title: "Awful C++ code patterns to use when you hate your team"
---

Here is a collection of god-awful C++ code patterns that should be kept far away from production
code. But if you hate your team and feels daring enough then try to get these code patterns

None of them is undefined or unspecified behavior thing. But they are awful nonetheless.
